            "Crescent City has experienced repeated tsunamis caused mainly by distant subduction earthquakes and occasional local events. Waves have surged into the harbor and low-lying neighborhoods, damaging docks, boats, and shoreline businesses and depositing sediment and debris. Physical damage often concentrates on maritime infrastructure while evacuations and warning systems have limited fatalities and injuries over recent decades. Historical events have shown how quickly coastlines can change, and local fisheries and tourism have sometimes suffered prolonged interruption.\n\nMitigation combines structural upgrades and community preparedness. The harbor has been rebuilt with stronger, deeper pilings and sacrificial dock elements designed to absorb wave forces. Seawalls, raised walkways, and elevated utilities protect important corridors. Authorities run sirens, maintain evacuation maps, and practice regular drills so residents move quickly inland. Land-use controls and retrofit programs reduce vulnerability and shorten recovery times after each event. Local volunteer teams assist in post-event cleanups.",

However, distant tsunamis generated by far-off seismic events in the Pacific Ocean could potentially affect the area, though such events are rare and typically result in minor sea level changes rather than catastrophic flooding. The city's deep natural harbor and protective headlands reduce its exposure to tsunami impact. While Australia's eastern margin borders a relatively stable tectonic plate, tsunamis generated in the Pacific could potentially reach New South Wales. \n\nHistorically, Sydney has recorded a few minor tsunami waves, most recently in 2022 and 2023, following distant Pacific earthquakes.
